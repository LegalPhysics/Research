# Research Notes:


## Introduction to Legal Issues Related to Big Data
 - Drill Down Illustration: 
  >> What is Personal Identity in the Age of Big Data?
 - Fundamental Legal Horizon Scan  
  >> Regulatory Schemes; (eg SEC and XBRL, then FCRA/HIPAA/FERPA/etc)  
  >> Contracts/Licenses, (eg eContracts and Automated Rules Compliance)  
  >> Privacy/FIPS, (eg Informed Consent for HD Studies)  
  >> Security/Surveillance; (eg Snowden)  
  >> Identity/Agency; (eg Electronic Transactions with Automated Agents)  
  >> Torts/Equity; (eg Class Actions and Novel Equitable Remedies)  
  >> Crime/Fraud (eg Cybercrimes)  
  >> IP/Property (eg WIPO and UDRP)  
  >> Accreditation/Certification (eg Data-Driven Operating Rules and Trustmarks)  
  >> Licensing/Permitting (eg Boston YELP Integration w/Health Inspections)  
  >> Criminal/Civil Judicial Procedure (eg Big Data and eDiscover)  
 - Legal Adoption and Adaptation  
  >> Public / Private Law Methods and Mechanisms  
  >> Legislatures, Judiciaries and Agencies / Federal, State and Local Government)  
  >> Industry Groups, Trade Associations, SROs, Standards Committees, etc  
  >> NCCUSL/NCSL, ALI/ABA/State Bars, etc  
  >> Uniform Law/Regulation, Model Contracts/Rules, Standard Terms/Clauses  

## Synthesized Legal Horizon View
 - "Personal Data" and "Private Data"
 - "Proprietary Data" and "Partner Data"
 - "Protection of Data" and "Provenance of Data"

## Key Policy Issues
 - Lack of Overarching Legal, Regulatory and Policy Scheme for Big Data
 - Contextual Blur: Social, Workplace, Civic, Surveillance, Education, Health, etc

## Life Cycle Overview 
 - Legal Life Cycle    
  >> Rules for Roles, Relationships & Recourse  
  >> Sequences and Cycles of Rule Making, Rule Application & Rule Adjudication  
   ->> XML & JSON Structure/Accessibility of Laws/Rules and the Data Driven Network Jurisdiction of Business/Gov't  
 - Business Life Cycle   
  >> Data-Driven Networked Organizations and Operations  
  >> Sequences and Cycles of Entity Creation, Interactions/Reporting, Dissolution  
   ->>  "Legal Entity Identifies" (LEIs) and the Data Driven Identity of Businesses/Gov't  
 - Technical Life Cycle  
  >> Systems for Services & Software  
  >> Sequences and Cycles of Actors, Actions and Applications  
   ->> API/REST Endpoints for fast-flow of functional externalization and the Data Driven Boundary Line of Business/Gov't  

## Looking Forward: Innovations & Ideas  
 - Policy Proposal for New Deal on Data & Distributed/Heterogeneous Database Systems   
 - Pilot Proposal for ClearButton Personal Data User Notice Registry
