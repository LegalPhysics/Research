# Next Steps

Two project areas of focus for this internship:

## Using Writing Fellow and HuffPo Editorial Intern and Blogger Chops to work for Legal Physics Wordpress Site

Helping organize and structure and write and copyedit the grand relaunc of the blog.  

## Plain Language Project

One of the tabs of the blog should be focused on plain language and this is a project you can drive.

- Write up the project plan for this and let's use it as our guide and evolve it as we go.
- Consider how to reflect three levels: plain language (for business and consumer oriented readers), Legal and Tech.
- Consider how you would approah this uniform draft law in this way: [“Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act”](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Committee.aspx?title=Fiduciary%20Access%20to%20Digital%20Assets)

## Meeting and Work Pace

Let us plan daily meetings in person or online if I am not in the lab.
