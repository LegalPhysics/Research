The New Deal on Data - Overview

1. What is the New Deal on Data?

a) What is the New Deal on Data?

(Quote from Big Data and Privacy Book chapter that Sandy and Dazza re writing)
“Personal Data: Emergence of a New Asset Class

It has long been recognized that the first step to promoting liquidity in land and commodity markets is to guarantee ownership rights   so that people can safely buy and sell. Similarly, the first step toward creating greater idea and idea flow (`idea liquidity’) is to define ownership rights . The only politically viable course is to give individual citizens rights over data that are about them and in fact, in the European Union these rights flow directly from the constitution. We need to recognize personal data as a valuable asset of the individual that is given to companies and government in return for services .  

The simplest approach to defining what it means to “own your own data” is to draw an analogy with the English common law ownership rights of possession, use, and disposal:

• You have the right to possess data about you. Regardless of what entity collects the data, the data belong to you, and you can access your data at any time. Data collectors thus play a role akin to a bank, managing the data on behalf of their “customers.”

• You have the right to full control over the use of your data. The terms of use must be opt-in and clearly explained in plain language. If you are not happy with the way a company uses your data, you can remove the data, just as you would close your account with a bank that is not providing satisfactory service. 

• You have the right to dispose of or distribute your data. You have the option to have data about you destroyed or re-deployed elsewhere. 

Individual rights to personal data must be balanced with the need of corporations and governments to use certain data – account activity, billing information, and so on – to run their day-to-day operations. This New Deal on Data therefore gives individuals the right to possess, control, and dispose of copies of these required operational data, along with copies of the incidental data collected about you such as location and similar context. 

Note that these ownership rights are not exactly the same as literal ownership under modern law, but the practical effect is that disputes are resolved in a different, simpler manner than would be the case for (as an example) land ownership disputes.

In 2007, one author (Pentland) first proposed the New Deal on Data to the World Economic Forum. Since then, this idea has run through various discussions and eventually helped shape the 2012 Consumer Data Bill of Rights in the United States, along with a matching declaration on Personal Data Rights in the EU. These new regulations hope to accomplish the combined trick of breaking data out of the current silos, thus enabling public goods, while at the same time giving individuals greater control over data about them. But, of course this is still a work in progress and the battle for individual control of personal data rages onward.”

b) Big Data and Computational Models 

Context of Big Data and Computational models in general:

* Unlike the past, today there are now computational methods that can provide a 360 view of a person based upon inputting several individual bits of PII into models.

* Unlike in the past, today it is possible to have real time and robust computational analysis available for individuals as well as for large organizations. By using an openPDS implementation and  This means that 

* Unlike the past there is now a possibity for big data to be used to help inform policy and law making and to ensure that our rules are working well.  For example… reports of the proceding of oversight committees or secret courts can be used as inputs to higher level rules to ensure that oversight is happening in a meaningful and comprehensive manner (ie if there are virtually no rejections and if there are many “population wide” data gathering programs that have no Privacy Act SORNs then a notice for additional oversight is automatically sent to the agency Inspector General and the House and Senate oversight committees and other such automated rules based and data driven methods).
