The Rise (and Fall?) of a Third Party 

The International Pirate Party movement calls itself "the fastest growing political movement in the world." 

## Research Questions

Can we assess and/or understand the growth of new political parties as a product of human interactions in a network? 
Does the rise of the Pirate Party in Europe offer an opportunity to map the emergence of a political party? 
Are we able to determine markers that assess the efficiency of a third party's spread in ideas? 
Are third parties the product of linking a number of various grassroots efforts to each other, or is top-down rallying around a single issue more common? 
Does mapping participation in third-party activism across geography and time reveal trends in growth or acceptance on a national scale?
