# Wikileaks as Data

## Question: Can we turn a data dump of 5 million emails between government, corporate, and news actors -- all linked by their use of a single private intelligence firm -- into usable information about overlap among these groups?

Research: 

Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science: Examination of group interactions through e-mail data

What are the temporal dynamics of human communications—that is, do work groups reach a stasis with little change, or do they dramatically change over time (2, 3)? What interaction patterns predict highly productive groups and individuals? Can the diversity of news and content we receive predict our power or performance (4)?
