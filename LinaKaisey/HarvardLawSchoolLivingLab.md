The legal field both shapes and is shaped by repeated interactions among numerous actors. This process of norm creation through interactions begins early, in the law school setting. Based on this principle, Social Physics methods can be used to understand observable phenomena that have eluded explanation so far at Harvard Law School. This includes answering questions like: why do women account for only 20% of those graduating with honors, and only 9% of law review editors? Why do many students who enter law school aspiring to make their careers in public interest instead take jobs at corporate law firms?
While qualitative answers to these questions have been proposed, Social Physics experiments might shed light on quantifiable underlying causes. These answers can help students and administrators shape polices at Harvard Law School, while also creating an understanding of the socialization process that follows all law students once they graduate and enter the legal field. Three proposed projects will help demystify the Social Physics postulates shaping norms and attitudes at Harvard Law School:
Project Proposal 1: Social Interaction. This study will gauge student academic performance and career attitudes to determine if “birds of a feather flock together” when it comes to excelling academically and picking career paths. Students will be outfitted with phones that gather geolocation data, and will regularly fill out questionnaires to assess academic performance (including grades, law review participation, and federal court clerkship acceptance) and career goals (including perceived likelihood that the student will work in a public interest position soon after graduation). The geolocation data will be compared against the questionnaire results to determine if “tribes” of students emerge at HLS, and if so, when.
Project Proposal 2: Class Engagement. This study will gauge student participation in class discussions to determine if any group “hogs the ball” when it comes to class discussion. Students will be outfitted with microphones or sociometric badges during class time, to measure each student’s engagement in real time. This data will be compared against background information about the student to determine if a particular group—e.g., men or women; public school alumni or private school alumni—play a particularly large role in class discussion. Furthermore, some classrooms will be outfitted with Meeting Mediator Systems (basically, an iPad display that visualizes where the balance of the conversation lies, see “Social Physics,” pg 109) to provide real-time feedback about who is engaged in class. This data will be used to determine if real-time feedback provided to professors and/or students results in a rebalancing of class discussion.

Project Proposal 3: Class selection clusters. This study will gauge students’ course selection to determine if “tribes” of students can be identified based on course selection habits. Anonymized course selection data for each student will be gathered from the HLS Registrar and analyzed over the students’ time spent at HLS, to determine if, when, and where students’ course selection preferences converge. For example, if all students who take a Corporations class later enroll in a Securities Regulation class, this information helps define the parameters of a “Corporate” tribe. If there is a cross-section of students from the “Public Interest” tribe and students from the “Corporate” tribe in a Social Ventures class, the administration may elect to provide more such classes to facilitate cross-pollination between tribes. 
The results of the above experiments will enable HLS students to maximize their three years of law school, administrators to shape policies that account for student practices, and everyone to better understand how attitudes toward legal practice are shaped in academic and social settings.

##Motivating Questions

There are significant failures in idea flow over there, and both students and faculty have been struggling to answer questions such as

"Why do men consistently outperform women at HLS, despite the fact that women and men enter HLS with equal academic qualifications?" 

"Students enter HLS with diverse interests and job goals, yet the majority of students shift their focus over the course of completing their degree, and take a job at a corporate law firm upon graduation. Why?"

Suggested answers to these questions are broad and based in sociological assumptions. Eg for question 1, the answer is assumed to be "law school class format favors a "masculine" way of learning." For question 2, many say "students are forced to accept or reject law firms' offers early in their academic trajectory, and don't have time to consider alternate options that may be preferable."

But I think it comes down to whom you hang out with: those who surround themselves with successful students become successful students. Those who surround themselves with public interest--oriented students are less likely to fall into the corporate track just because it seems like "the rational thing that other rational people are doing."

##Project Proposal 1: Harvard Living Lab

Apply the same methods as the living lab that took place at MIT. The methodology would include a combination of outfitting students with smartphones (or sociometric badges) to track their locations, and questionnaires to understand their performance at HLS and their attitudes toward legal practice.

MIT students' social networks were mapped using smartphones that detected geolocation. This data was compared against responses to questionnaires that asked about the students' political preferences. The result: where and with whom the students spent time was a good predictor of their subjective political preferences.

While the questionnaires in the MIT study covered political preference, ours would cover even more easy-to-define outputs: 1. Career plans 2. Grades 3. Law review acceptance and 4. Clerkship acceptances are examples. We could supplement these with more subjective questions, too, to understand how students' understanding of the function of lawyers changes over time.

##Project Proposal 2: Classroom Engagement Feedback 

We could use a "Meeting Mediator System" (see Social Physics, pg 109) to determine what relative class engagement is like among men v. women, public school v. private school alumni, etc. HBS had similar problems to HLS when it came to the relative engagement of women in class. To solve this problem, they employed a transcriptionist to sit in each class and type out the contents of the day's discussion, then hand-code the results to determine the relative frequency of female participation. We could use sociometric badges to gather the same data in real time. Not only that, we could use the Meeting Mediator System (basically, an iPad that displays where the balance of communication is in a discussion) to alert professors as to when a particular subset of students is participating more heavily in class. We can compare outputs across classes that include a Meeting Mediator System with those that don't to demonstrate that engagement is more distributed when professors and/or students have real-time feedback that, e.g., the class discussion is being dominated by men.

##Project Proposal 3: Law Review Text Analysis 

Each spring, HLS 1Ls submit a draft of writing to be considered for membership on the Harvard Law Review. Though the submissions are completely anonymized (i.e., the current Law Review students who judge the competition do not know the entrant's gender or any other identifying information), selected participants in harvard law review are dramatically skewed. In 2013, the editorial board was overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly a product of private rather public undergraduate institutions. Some have speculated that the selection process perpetuates the skewed make-up of the board: students like the writing style of students who are similar to them, so perhaps there is a "male" or "private school" way of writing the HLR submission. As students from the current board select the anonymous writing of students who share similarities to their writing style, the effect compounds over time. 

I'd like to do a text analysis on the anonymous HLR submissions, to determine if there are writing patterns that emerge over time. Last year, the HLR instituted a new policy of affirmative action for female applicants, because they have struggled to address and understand the skewed make-up for so long. So, I hope they will be interested in sharing batches of anonymized submissions. 

##Project Proposal 4: Class Selection Clusters - In Progress

* Oren spoke with Ali and learned Sandy and Ali conducted some research on MIT student enrollment in course data looking at patterns related to students in Venture classes... Sandy has access to the underlying dataset including which course identified students took.  
* Lina contacted HLS Registrar and submitted a proposal for the same data from HLS students 
* Outcome of meeting between Ali, Oren, and Sandy: ?


##Next Steps

Project ownership. How long will project approval take? What role for Lina, who is really invested? What are handoff points?   

##Feedback at Human Dynamics Lunch Group
* HLR study: split into piles based upon what “sounds feminine” and what “sounds male” – get people who are not law review, but are like law review, to split them up. 
* can you come up with some factors like “balanced”  and “moderate” on one side and “emphatic” on another side etc, and then code the submissions based on those factors. Then, do the two piles correspond to “men” and “women”?
* length of sentences, complexity of words. Sophistication of language and aggressiveness of tone.
* key: women were spending more time at bars because they cared about their social lives.
* To read: Arek's paper, at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7233v1.pdf
* Getting student course selections: show clusters based on which people take which classes. Could result in course recommendations. Get historical records: see what careers people go into.
* Oren: just use one microphone to record rather than using sociometric badges
