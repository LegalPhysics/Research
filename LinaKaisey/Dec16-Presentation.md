Motivating question: Can we understand the interactions that give rise to law using computational analytics?





1. Wikileaks as Data

Question: Can we turn a data dump of 5 million emails between government, corporate, and news actors -- all linked by their use of a single private intelligence firm -- into usable information about overlap among these groups?

Research: 

Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science: Examination of group interactions through e-mail data

What are the temporal dynamics of human communications—that is, do work groups reach a stasis with little change, or do they dramatically change over time (2, 3)? What interaction patterns predict highly productive groups and individuals? Can the diversity of news and content we receive predict our power or performance (4)?

2. Role of Corporations in Legislature

Question: Can we come up with a computational means of analyzing the relevance of lobbying efforts upon government actors and legislation?

3. The Rise (and Fall?) of a Third Party
international Pirate Party movement calls itself "the fastest growing political movement in the world."
Can we assess and/or understand the growth of new political parties as a product of human interactions in a network? Does the rise of the Pirate Party in Europe offer an opportunity to map the emergence of a political party? Are we able to determine markers that assess the efficiency of a third party's spread in ideas? Are third parties the product of linking  a number of various grassroots efforts to each other, or is top-down rallying around a single issue more common? Does mapping participation in third-party activism across geography and time reveal trends in growth or acceptance on a national scale?
