Outline of approach to clinical placement at MIT Media Lab Human Dynamics group:

# What:


## Quick-Turn Around Computational Legal Science study
* The Ankur and Ray thingy


## Policy Proposal 

* Like a policy paper (not a dense scholarly article) describing big data and the law (focus on privacy) issues/problems and proposed solutions.  

Intend to conduct a computational social science research study in the vein of HDL BUT focused on the law.  This can be an input to the approach and recommendations being formed for the policy blog.  

* Expected in the Form of an Online Resource, eg a blog (wordpress or blogger) 

Anticipated to include the following vantage points and solution components: 

1. Addressing Data Aggregators/Brokers (eg NSA, Axiom, etc) 

Human Dynamics Lab Approach: Sandy's Proposal for Decentralized and Externally Held Data Collections WITH Meta-Data on the Meta-Data trusted custodians and independent review (see article).  

2. Addressing Private Organizations and Civilian Gov't Agency Collection and Use of Personal Data/Big Data

Human Dynamics Lab Approach: ClearButton, Personal Data Services/Trust Networks Approach

3. Addressing Individual Role and Control of Their Personal Data (and engagement in Big Data world):

Human Dynamics Lab Approach: Personal Data Stores in a Personal Data Ecology (see WEF papers and Sandy's work and Brian's tech stuff w/ openPDS in GitHub repo).



* Who:

Dazza is Legal Supervisor from Media Lab for this Clinical Placement (who recommends credit or fail)
Written evaluation of the student's work.

Lina is Clinical Legal Intern from Harvard Law School 


Professor Hymann is the Harvard Law School Faculty Supervisor (who decides credit or fail)
