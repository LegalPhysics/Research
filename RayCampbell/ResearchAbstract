My primary researach interest is to understand possible legal and policy mechanisms that can make markets for personal data more effective by giving greater power to individuals regarding access to and uses of their personal data.  I am particularly interested in exploring economic research on markets that are characterized by information asymmetry between the participants to see if it offers actionable insights that are relevant to markets for personal data.  I believe application and extension of this research on information asymmetry can point the way to legal and policy interventions that can be part of a New Deal on Data and thereby improve the functioning of these markets.
