from chat session - edits for abstract of research statement:

can you translate the datasets related to public policy into coherent and usable narratives?  how can visualizations and other methods be used as actual tools and mechanisms for public administration and/or business management?
 
some of the work is pure research (trying some stuff and seeing what hits or developing options for different avenues of future research, etc).  other stuff he really wants is more directly educational.  

how can research at human dynamics develop a little resource that really explains and transmits the "way of thinking" reflected by data-driven analytics.  he wants to come up with an elearning or other method to convey how this lense changes the way you see the world.

can we do a rapid/agile video clip and blog post of ray on what big data is from a public policy vantage point and how it can be used in a transformational way - ideally, anchor video clip and post with the concept for a disclosre rule / ClearButton initiative, describing perhaps a) how it could work today, and b) in 18 months and c) in 5 years.
