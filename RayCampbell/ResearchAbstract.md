**Ray Campbell Research Abstract:**

There are two issues I would like to research in collaboration with the Human Dynamics Lab.  

* First, I am interested in exploring the implications of a disclosure rule that would give individuals an inalienable right to know certain key information about commercial and governmental uses of their personal information.  I believe a defining flaw in today's information markets is the inability of individuals to see and understand the downstream uses of their personal information.  Ownership rights, while fundamental for other reasons, do not solve this problem because owners can waive all their rights with a simple mouse click.  Correcting this market failure is necessary for efficient markets for personal data.  To be effective, a disclosure rule would need to be implemented algorithmically (as envisioned in the Clear Button prototype), giving individuals the ability to "data mine the data miners."  

* The second area I would like to explore is the application of reality mining and social physics concepts to the law, public policy, and politics.  I am interested in finding ways that these breakthrough insights pioneered by the Human Dynamics Lab can shed light on issues of law and policy.  Related to this, I am also interested in using big data analytic tools and visualization techniques to illuminate matters of civic importance.
