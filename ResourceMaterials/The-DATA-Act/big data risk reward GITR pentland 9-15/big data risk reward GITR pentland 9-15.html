<div style=""><span class="ft154">OVERVIEW</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft226">In June 2013, massive U.S. surveil ance of phone records and Internet data was revealed by</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft290">former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden, who cal ed these activities the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft376">“architecture of oppression.” His disclosures ignited an overdue public debate on the balance between</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft442">personal privacy and our growing digital capabilities regarding the col ection and use of personal data.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft506">Finding this balance is an issue of vital and urgent interest to corporations and governments, as well as</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft572">ordinary citizens around the world. This report will outline both the risks and the rewards of this new</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft633">age of big data, address policy issues in this area and provide practical recommendations for a way</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft636">forward.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft643">INTRODUCTION</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft711">Data about human behavior, such as census data, have always been essential for both</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft785">government and industry. In recent years, however, a new methodology for collecting these data about</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft854">human behavior has emerged. By analyzing patterns within the `digital breadcrumbs’ that we all leave</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft921">behind us as we move through the world – call records, credit card transactions, and GPS location fixes,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft991">etc. – scientists are discovering that we can begin to explain many things – financial crashes, revolutions,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1067">panics – that previously appeared to be random events. These new tools, with their view of life in all its</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1136">complexity, are the future of social science and public policy. Just as the microscope and telescope</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1215">revolutionized the study of biology and astronomy, `socioscopes’ have the potential to revolutionize</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1231">regulation and public policy.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1287">The risk of deploying this sort of data driven policy and regulation comes from the danger of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1360">putting so much personal data in the hands of either companies or governments. Fortunately, new</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1441">approaches to regulation and technology have been developed that can help protect personal privacy</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1509">from exploitation, and can mitigate the problem of government overreach as wel . Both regulation and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1581">technology must continue to evolve in order to provide more scientific, real-time public policy while not</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1647">exposing citizens to the dangers of exploitative companies or an al -knowing authoritarian government;</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1695">this report will provide practical recommendations to achieve these goals.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1709">A BIG DATA TAXONOMY</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1772">It is probably hopeless to try to provide a detailed taxonomy of data types and uses because the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1847">technology is progressing so quickly. But it is possible to provide a broad taxonomy framed in terms of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1919">control. The three main divisions within the spectrum of data control are: (1) data commons, which are</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1978">available to all, with at most minor limitations on use; (2) personal or proprietary data, typically</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2046">control ed by individuals or companies, for which there needs to be legal and technology infrastructure</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2114">that provides strict control and auditing of use; and (3) the secret data of governments which typically</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2181">has less direct public oversight and more stringent controls. The issues with data commons will be</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2239">addressed first, followed by personal and proprietary data, and then government secret data.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2296">The preferred lens for examining these issues is experimentation in the real world, rather than</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2363">arguments from theory or first principles, because using massive, live data to design institutions and</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft2429">policies is outside of our traditional way of managing things. In this new digital era we cannot only rely</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2495">on existing policy, tradition or even laboratory science, because the strengths and weaknesses of big</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2556">data analysis are very different from standard information sources. To begin to manage our society in a</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2624">data driven manner requires us to move beyond academic debate and laboratory question-and-</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2687">answering processes. Instead, we need to try out new policy ideas within living laboratories – real,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2760">diverse communities that are willing to try a new way of doing things – in order to test and prove our</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2826">ideas. This is new territory and so it is important for us to constantly try out new ideas in the real world</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2860">in order to see what works and what doesn’t.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2869">DATA COMMONS</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft2927">The first entry in the data taxonomy is the data commons. A key insight is that our data are</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3004">worth more when shared because they can inform improvements in systems such as public health,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3073">transportation, and government. Using a “digital data commons” can potentially give us unprecedented</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3141">instrumentation of how our policies are performing so we can know when to take action to quickly and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3163">effectively address the situation.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3220">We already have many data commons available: maps, census data, and financial indices. With</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3288">the advent of big data we can potential y develop many more types of data commons, and these</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3353">commons can be both `real time’ and far more detailed than previous examples. This is because these</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3418">new digital commons depend mostly on data that are already produced as a side-effect of ongoing daily</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3489">life (e.g., digital transaction records, cel phone location fixes, road toll records, etc.) and because they</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3548">can be produced automatical y by computers without human intervention.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3612">One major concern with such a data commons is that they can endanger personal privacy.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3676">Another secondary concern involves the tension between commercial or personal interests: these</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3751">proprietary interests might tend to reduce the richness of such a commons, and diminish the ability of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3794">such a data commons to enable significant public goods.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3854">To explore the viability of a big data commons, what is perhaps the world’s first true ‘big data’</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3918">commons was unveiled on May 1, 2013. In this Data for Development (D4D) initiative, ninety research</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft3984">organizations from around the world reported hundreds of results from their analysis of data describing</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4049">the mobility and call patterns of the citizens of the entire African country of Ivory Coast [1]. The data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4110">were donated by the mobile carrier Orange, with help from the University of Louvain (Belgium) and my</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4175">lab at MIT (United States), along with collaboration from Bouake University (Ivory Coast), the United</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4234">Nation’s Global Pulse, the World Economic Forum, and the GSMA (which is the mobile carriers’</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4294">international trade association). The D4D progam was led by Nicolas De Cordes (Orange), Vincent</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4357">Blondel (Louvain), Alex Pentland (MIT), Robert Kirkpatrick (UN Global Pulse), and Bill Hoffman (World</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4368">Economic Forum).</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4433">The ninety projects that explored the use of this data commons cover many different aspects of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4498">better governance. An example of using the D4D data to improve social equality was highlighted by</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4574">work done by researchers at the University Col ege of London, who developed a method for mapping</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4643">poverty from the diversity of cell phone usage. As people have more disposable income, their patterns</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4709">of movement and pattern of phone calls becomes increasingly diverse. Another example of using the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4769">D4D data for social equality is the mapping of ethnic boundaries by researchers from the University of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4829">California, San Diego. This method relies on the fact that ethnic and language groups communicate far</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4907">more within their own group than they communicate with others groups. This project is significant</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft4975">because, while we know that ethic violence often erupts along such boundaries, the government and aid</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5025">agencies are usually uncertain about the geography of these social fault zones.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5085">The D4D data was utilized to understand and promote operational efficiency through an analysis</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5149">by IBM’s Dublin laboratory of Ivory Coast’s the public transportation system. This analysis showed that</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft0">2</span></div>
<hr>
<a name="3">
</a><div style=""><span class="ft71">Accepted to World Economic Forum Annual Global IT Report, copyright Alex Pentland 9/2013</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5226">for very little cost, the average commute time in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast’s biggest city, could be cut by</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5294">10 percent. Other research groups demonstrated similar potentials for operational improvements in the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5330">areas of government, commerce, agriculture, and finance.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5388">Finally, examples of using D4D data to improve social resiliency include analysis of disease</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5457">spread by groups from Novi Sad University (Serbia), EPFL (Switzerland), and Birmingham (UK). These</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5538">research groups showed that smal changes in the public health system could potential y cut the spread</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5588">of flu by 20 percent as well as significantly reducing the spreads of HIV and malaria.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5653">These selected results are just a smal sample of the impressive work that is made possible by</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5707">this rich and unique data commons. These results and others like them are available at</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5783">http://www.d4d.orange.com/home. Each of these D4D research projects has demonstrated the great</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5844">potential of a big data commons for improving society. From the point of view of Orange, it also</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5922">demonstrates the potential for new lines of business that combine this data commons with customers</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft5987">personal data: Imagine phone apps that advises commuters about which bus wil get them to work</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6030">quickest, or helps citizens reduce the risk of catching the flu.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6085">The work of these ninety research groups also suggests that many of the privacy fears</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6160">associated with the release of data about human behavior may be general y misunderstood. In this data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6241">commons, the data were processed by advanced computer algorithms (e.g., sophisticated sampling and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6309">use of aggregated indicators) so that it was unlikely that any individual could be re-identified. In fact, no</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6393">path to re-identification was discovered by the even though several of the research groups that studied</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6412">this specific question.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6465">In addition, while the data were freely available for any legitimate research that a group was</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6536">interested in, the data were distributed under a legal contract that specified that they the data could</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6614">only be used for the purpose proposed and only by the specific people making the proposal. A similar</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6676">technology-legal framework is used in trust networks described in the next section. The use of both</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6737">advanced computer algorithms and contract law to specify and audit how personal data may be used</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6799">and shared is the goal of new privacy regulations in the EU, the United States, and elsewhere.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6820">PERSONAL AND PROPRIETARY DATA</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6883">The second category in the data taxonomy is personal and proprietary data, typically controlled</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6944">by individuals or companies, for which there needs to be legal and technology infrastructure that</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7008">provides strict control and auditing of use. The current best practice is a system of data sharing called</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7077">trust networks [2,3,4]. Trust networks are a combination of a computer network that keeps track of user</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7148">permissions for each piece of personal data, and a legal contract that specifies both what can and can’t</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7215">be done with the data and what happens if there is a violation of the permissions. This is the model of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7282">personal data management that is most frequently proposed within the World Economic Forum</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7296">Personal Data Initiative.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7362">In such a system all personal data have attached labels specifying what the data can, and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7422">cannot, be used for. These labels are exactly matched by terms in a legal contract between al the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7491">participants stating penalties for not obeying the permission labels and giving the right to audit the use</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7576">of the data. Having permissions, including the provenance of the data, al ows automatic auditing of data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7619">use and allows individuals to change their permissions and withdraw data.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7690">Today, there are long-standing versions of trust networks that have proven to be both secure</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7754">and robust. The best known example is the SWIFT network for inter-bank money transfer and its most</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7830">distinguishing feature is that it has never been hacked. When asked why he robbed banks, bank robber</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7898">Willie Sutton famously said, `because that’s where the money is’. In today’s world, the SWIFT network is</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft7963">where the money is – trillions of dollars per day. This trust network has not only kept the robbers away,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8029">but it also makes sure the money reliably goes where it is supposed to go. Until recently such systems</span></div>

<a name="4">
</a><div style=""><span class="ft71">Accepted to World Economic Forum Annual Global IT Report, copyright Alex Pentland 9/2013</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8096">were only for the `big guys’. To give individuals a similarly safe method of managing personal data, my</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8166">research group and I here at MIT, in partnership with the Institute for Data Driven Design</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8246">(http://idcubed.org), have helped build openPDS (open Personal Data Store), a consumer version of this</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8305">type of system and are now testing it with a variety of industry and government partners [4].</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8370">A major concern about trust networks is the cost associated with keeping track of permissions</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8432">and supporting the capability for automated auditing. Since many companies maintain such data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8499">structures already in order to support internal compliance and auditing functions, the cost concern does</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8562">not seem to be a major barrier. Another more serious concern, however, is the extent to which</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8638">incidental data about human behavior must be included in the permissions and auditing framework.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8708">Such data are typically collected in the course of normal operations in order to support those operations</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8781">(e.g., the location of a cel phone is required to complete phone cal s) but without specific informed</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8848">consent. A final concern is that a trust network system may be too complex for average people to use,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8906">or that it will not inspire (or deserve) the sort of user trust that the name suggests.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft8974">In order to investigate these concerns, a living lab has been launched with the city of Trento in</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9047">Italy, supported by Telecom Italia, Telefonica, my MIT research group, the Fondazione Bruno Kessler, the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9113">Institute for Data Driven Design, and local companies within Trento. Importantly, this living lab has the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9175">approval and informed consent of all its participants – they know that they are part of a real-world</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9216">experiment whose goal is to invent a better way of living [5].</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9275">The goal of this living lab is to develop new ways of sharing data to promote greater civic</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9336">engagement and information diffusion. One specific goal is to build upon and test trust-network</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9407">software such as the openPDS system, by deploying a set of “personal data services” designed to enable</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9472">users to col ect, store, manage, disclose, share and use data about themselves. For example, the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9535">openPDS system lets the community of young families learn from each other without the work of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9596">entering data by hand or the risk of sharing through current social media. These data can then be used</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9657">for the personal self-empowerment of each member, or (when aggregated) for creation of a data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9719">commons that supports improvement of the community. The ability to share data safely should enable</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9781">better idea flow among individuals, companies, and government, and we want to see if these tools can</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9832">in fact increase productivity and creative output at the scale of an entire city.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9890">The Trento living lab will also investigate how to deal with the sensitivities of collecting and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft9964">using deeply personal data in real-world situations. For example, it wil explore different techniques and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10035">methodologies to protect the users’ privacy while at the same time being able to use these personal</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10107">data to generate a useful data commons. It will also explore different user interfaces for privacy settings,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10193">for configuring the data col ected, for the data disclosed to applications and for those shared with other</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10259">users, all in the context of a trust framework. While the Trento experiment is still in its early days, the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10318">initial reaction from participating families is that these sorts of data sharing capabilities are valuable, and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10355">they feel safe sharing their data using the openPDS system.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10366">GOVERNMENT DATA</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10424">The third category in the taxonomy is secret government data. A major risk of deploying data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10503">driven policies and regulations comes from the danger of putting so much personal data in the hands</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10585">governments. But how can it happen that governments, especial y authoritarian governments, choose</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10651">to limit their reach? The answer is that unlimited access to data about the citizen behavior is a great</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10713">danger to the government as well as the citizenry. Consider the NSA’s response to the recent Snowden</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10716">leaks:</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10777">“This failure originated from two practices that we need to reverse,” Ashton B. Carter, the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10840">deputy secretary of defense, said recently. “There was an enormous amount of information concentrated</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft0">4</span></div>

<a name="5">
</a><div style=""><span class="ft71">Accepted to World Economic Forum Annual Global IT Report, copyright Alex Pentland 9/2013</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10897">in one place,” he said. “That’s a mistake.” And second, no individual should be given the kind of access</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10916">Mr. Snowden had, Mr. Carter said.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft10955">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/sunday-review</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11025">That is, the government must organize big data resources in a distributed manner, with each</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11089">different type of data separated and dispersed among many locations, using many different types of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11163">computer systems and encryption. Similarly, human resources should be organized into cells of access</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11237">and permission that are localized both spatial y and by data type. Both computer and human resources</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11304">should always be redundant and fragmented in order to avoid overly-powerful central actors.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11373">The logic behind this observation is that databases which have different types of data that are</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11441">physically and logically distributed, and which also have heterogeneous computer and encryption</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11514">systems, are hard to attack, both physically as well as through cyber attack. This is because any single</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11578">exploit is likely to gain access to only a limited part of the whole database. Similarly, the resilience of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11638">organizations with a heterogeneous cell-like human and permissions structure is familiar from</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11705">intelligence and terrorist organizations. Importantly, resistance to attack by adopting a distributed</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11773">organization is a particularly pressing issue for authoritarian governments, because unfettered access to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11844">data about citizen behavior can be a major aid to organizing a successful coup to overthrow the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11845">government.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11904">What does al this have to do with the danger that a big data government will trample individual</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft11971">freedoms? The key insight is that for these types of data systems, each type of data analysis operation</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12040">has a characteristic pattern of communication between different databases and human operators. As a</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12111">consequence it is possible to monitor the functioning of the data analysis process without access to, or</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12177">endangerment of, the analysis content. In short, one can use `metadata about metadata’ in order to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12250">monitor the use of metadata, and with some reasonable confidence ensure that only `normal’ analysis</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12326">operations are being conducted without reference to specific content. Governments that structure their</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12379">data resources in this manner can more easily monitor attacks and misuse of all sorts.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12432">As a concrete example let us assume a system in which different types of database are</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12497">physically distributed. In this case one can observe the amount and pattern of traffic between the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12562">different databases. These patterns are characteristic of the analysis being performed and so deviations</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12639">from the normal patterns of communication between databases are cause for concern. In this manner</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12703">an open civil authority can perform substantial, fairly effective monitoring of the functioning of a</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12769">classified agency. In most cases it is sufficient to that each element of the system only monitor local</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12833">traffic. Afamiliarexampleofthistypeofmonitoringisthe`manyeyes’securitystrategy.Whenpatterns</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12905">of communication among different departments are visible (as with physical mail), then the patterns of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft12972">`normal’ operations are also visible to many employees, even though the content of the operations</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13037">remains hidden. For example, a health official responsible for maintaining health records will be able to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13112">see if those records are suddenly being accessed by the finance records office with unusual frequency,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13179">and may inquire if that is proper. In contrast, when copies of all the data types are all in one place, it is</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13217">easy for people to conduct unauthorized analyses.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13284">The computer architecture for this type of system is very similar to the trust networks described</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13352">in the previous section: distributed data stores with permissions, provenance, and auditing for sharing</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13418">between data stores. In this case, however, the data stores are segmented by their referent, e.g., tax</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13486">records for individuals, tax records for companies, import records from country X to port Y, etc., rather</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13554">than having one data store per person. Because the architecture is so similar to the citizen-centric</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13614">personal data stores, it enables easier and safer sharing of data between citizens and government. For</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13687">this reason several states within the U.S. are beginning to test this architecture for both internal and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13707">external data analysis services.</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft13769">Finally, it should not escape the reader’s attention that all of these lessons also apply to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13843">companies with large, complex databases. Misbehavior by employees, industrial espionage, and cyber</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft1659">attack are among the greatest dangers that companies face in the big data era. A distributed</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft13986">architecture of databases joined with a network that supports permissions, provenance, and auditing</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14041">can reduce risk and increase resilience of companies’ internal data analysis functions.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14045">SUMMARY</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14102">We are entering a big data world, where governance is far more driven by data than in the past.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14166">Basic to the success of a data-driven society is the protection of personal privacy and freedom.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14233">Discussions at the World Economic Forum have made substantial contributions to altering the privacy</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14315">and data ownership standards around the world in order to give individuals unprecedented control over</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14376">data that are about them, while at the same time providing for increased transparency and engagement</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14407">in both the public and private spheres.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14460">We still face the challenge that large organizations, and in particular governments, may be</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14530">tempted to abuse the power of the data that they hold. To address this concern we need to establish</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14598">best practices that are in the interest of both large organizations and individuals. This paper has</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14679">suggested one path in which potential abuses of power can be limited, while at the same time providing</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14740">greater security for organizations that use big data. The key policy recommendations for all large</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14767">organizations, commercial or government, are that:</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14834">1) Large data systems should store data in a distributed manner, separated by type (e.g.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14899">financial vs. health) and real-world categories (e.g., individual vs. corporate), managed by a</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft14971">department whose function is focused on that data, and with sharing permissions set and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15039">monitored by personnel from that department. Best practice would have the custodians of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15100">data be regional and use heterogeneous computer systems. With such safeguards in place,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15152">it is difficult to attack many different types of data at once, and it is more difficult to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15193">combine data types without authentic authorization.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15248">2) Data sharing should always maintain provenance and permissions associated with data, and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15315">support automatic, tamper-proof auditing. Best practice would share only answers to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15378">questions about the data (e.g., by use of pre-programmed SQL queries known as `Database</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15435">Views’), rather than the data itself, whenever possible. This allows improved internal</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15500">compliance and auditing, and helps minimizes risk for unauthorized information leakage.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15561">3) Systems controlled by partner organizations, and not just your own systems, should be</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15621">secure. External data sharing should only be between data systems that have similar local</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15696">control, permissions, provenance, and auditing, and should include the use of standardized</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15758">legal agreements such as those employed in trust networks, as described earlier. Otherwise</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15817">data can be siphoned off at the data source or end consumer, without the need for</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15838">attacking central system directly.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15898">4) The need for a secure data ecosystem extends to the private data of individuals and the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft15960">proprietary data of partner companies. As a consequence best practice for data flows to</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16023">and from individual citizens and businesses is to require them to have secure personal data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16069">stores and be enrolled in a trust network data sharing agreement [2,3,4].</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16125">5) Al entities should employ secure identity credentials at al times. Best practice is to base</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16153">these credentials on biometric signatures [6].</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16209">6) Create an `open’ data commons that is available to partners under a lightweight legal</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16266">agreement, such as the trust network agreements. Open data can generate great value by</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16292">allowing third parties to improve services.</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft16353">While these recommendations might at first glance seem cumbersome, they are for the most</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16429">part easily implemented with the standard protocols found within modern computer databases and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16498">networks. In many cases, the use of distributed data stores and management are already part of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16574">current practice, and so the entire system will be simpler and cheaper to implement than a centralized</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16640">solution: all that is really new is the careful use of provenance, permissions and auditing within a legal or</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16704">regulatory framework such as a trust network. Most importantly, these recommendations will result in</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16769">a data ecosystem that is more secure and resilient, allowing us to safely reap the advantages of using big</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft16802">data to help set and monitor public policy.</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft17245">The Future of Big Data and Governance:</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17301">The D4D data commons is only a small first step toward improving governance by use of big</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17383">data. Much more can be accomplished, because our current understanding of policy and human society</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17449">is based on very limited data resources. Currently, most social science is based on either analysis of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17510">laboratory experiments or on survey data. These approaches also miss the critical fact that it is the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17572">details of which people you interact with, and how you interact with them that truly matter. Social</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17642">phenomena are really made up of billions of small transactions between individuals – people trading not</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17727">only goods and money but also information, ideas, or just gossip. There are patterns in those individual</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17795">transactions that drive phenomena such as financial crashes and Arab Springs. We need to understand</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17880">these micro-patterns because they don’t just average out to the classical way of understanding society.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17945">Big data gives us --- for the first time --- a chance to view society in all its complexity, composed of</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17981">millions of networks of person-to-person exchanges.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft17993">Living lab studies</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18050">Figure 1. Qualitative overview of social science “living labs” and traditional experiments, with</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft6975">the horizontal axis showing data collection duration and the vertical axis showing richness of the</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18184">information collected. Datasets include: (1) Most social science experiments, (2) Midwest Field Station</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18246">Study, (3) Framingham Heart Study, (4) Large Call Record datasets, (5) Reality Mining, (6) Social</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft18336">dataset, (10) where the world is headed.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18398">If we had a `God’s Eye’ all-seeing view, then we could potential y arrive at a true understanding</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18469">of how society works and develop scientifically proven methods to fix our problems. Unfortunately, as</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18530">illustrated in Figure 1, almost all data from traditional social science (labeled `1’) are near the (0,0)</span></div>

<div style=""><span class="ft18612">coordinate, meaning these datasets represent information gathered from under a hundred people and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18681">only for a few hours. The studies labeled `2’ and ‘3’ are some of the largest social science studies to date</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18753">[7,8]. In the last decade, computational social scientists have begun to discover how to leverage big data</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18821">and have been using datasets from companies such as cell phone carriers and social media firms. Typical</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18846">examples of these studies are labeled `4’.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18905">Unfortunately, even these large data sets are impoverished because they measure only a few</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft18973">variables at a time. Therefore, they provide a very limited view of human nature. Recently data scientists</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19036">have developed `living lab’ technologies for harvesting `digital breadcrumbs’ and are now obtaining</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19110">much richer descriptions of human behavior. The studies labeled 5, 6, 7 and 8 are Living Lab studies</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19186">using smart phones or electronic name badges (“sociometers”) to collect data [5,9]. The point labeled 9</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19246">is the Data for Development dataset covering the entire country of the Ivory Coast [1].</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19306">Just a brief examination of Figure 1 makes it easy to see that these living lab datasets are many</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19373">orders of magnitude richer than previous social science datasets. These large, digital datasets contain</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19452">extraordinary amounts of objective, continuous, dense data that al ow us to build quantitative,</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19510">predictive models of human behavior in complex, everyday situations.</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19571">Importantly, the point labeled `10’ is where the world is headed. In just a few short years we are</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19625">likely to have available incredibly rich data about the behavior of virtually all of humanity on a</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19688">continuous basis. The data mostly already exist in cell phone networks, credit card databases, and</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19754">elsewhere, but currently only technical gurus have access to these data. As these digital data become</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19817">more widely available for scientific inquiry we will be able to understand and manage ourselves in ways</span></div>
<div style=""><span class="ft19858">better suited to our complex, interconnected, and networked society.</span></div>
