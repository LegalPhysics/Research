consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, shall establish a pilot program 
relating to reporting by recipients of Federal funds (in this section

        contracts, grants, and subawards, the aggregate value of which 
        is not less than $1,000,000,000;

        awards; and

program, which shall include--

                    (A) consolidating some or all aspects of Federal 
                financial reporting to reduce the costs to recipients 
                of Federal funds;
                    (B) automating some or all aspects of Federal 
                financial reporting to increase efficiency and reduce 
                the costs to recipients of Federal funds; and
