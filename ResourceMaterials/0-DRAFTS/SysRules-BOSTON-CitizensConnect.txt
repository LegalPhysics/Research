me:  Hiya Nigel :-)  Please don't reply if you're not working!  Just read Susan's case study on you guys and: wow! (she totally reversed by bias vis Harvard!)....

me:  She talks about "Citizens Connect Version Four" with some very cool identity CRM sounding features... I'd love the chance to help update the terms for that (I think the direction of the policy terms flowing from the exec order thread would be right in line... and the CivicID stuff with Leland and Kansas etc on PublicEnterprise already includes most of the key items).  Anywho - great case-study and well deserved :-)
