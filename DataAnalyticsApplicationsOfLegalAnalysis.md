Below is some "relevant" info on the "legal relevance" aspect of this topic...

This is excellent. Thank you for diving right into the challenge I posed. You have provided a good basis for exploring how your skills at legal analysis can be applied and extended to data analytics and big data driven new ventures ... Among other uses. 

The summary you crafted is quite good in the context of Development Ventures to be sure. I'd like to connect the dots back directly to legal analysis as part of extrapolating the skill forward potentially as a contribution you could learn to make through your class project. 

Consider that the law is a highly information intensive field,  What enables any mediocre second year law student to plow through hundreds of pages of legislative, regulatory, judicial, contractual and other information like a hot knife through butter is simply knowing what is relevant and what is not. What is relevant on a page of text depends on what rule is applied and therefore what favored are important, potentially important or not important.  Knowing what set of rules to apply is the quintessential legal judgment. Applying the relevant legal rules to the relevant facts of a situation is - at its most fundamental expression - what it means to "practice law".  

The same general processes of "legal analysis" on large amounts of initially unfamiliar information in the service of novel situations comprising the practice of law can be recast and honed to recognize, apply appropriate algorithms and guide the flow of tomorrow's big data systems.  The big data entrepreneur of the immediate future is a "philosopher-king" hybrid role, exhibiting an adaptive mix of skills and techniques. The work of senior decision makers of the big data economy is to steward quickly evolving business models, innovative but short-lived technical mashups and complex emergent legal agreements, roles and corresponding relationships all of which are enabled, fueled and stressed by real-time infusions and exchanges of very large scale, heterogeneous and dynamic data-sets related to a wide variety of external parties, transactions, technologies and contexts - both upstream before receipt and ingestion into your system and also downstream after transmission to and sharing with the systems of others. 

There are business, legal and technical implications to the transformation of context within which the data exists when it is shared from one system to another. The ramifications for establishing what is relevant to the same data can be profound with each shift of operating environment, upon every new mashup and analysis, each modification of purpose and any switching of intention.  

To that end, I wonder if you would join me this weekend or early next week in the following thought experiment. I envision a conversation via Skype or Google hangout but feel free to write your ideas and share by email if you like. Based on the thought experiment below, I anticipate you will have a good access to use your legal talents to apply the wisdom upon which concepts of legal relevance have been built over centuries to the new science and practice of big data analytics in some way that can be used for a class project. 

1. Using the write up you sent me as a starting point, add a few sentences directly describing how the word "relevance" is defined and applied in and by the law.

Specifically, note that the meaning and methods for applying concepts of "relevance" vary - sometimes significantly - depending on the scenario of use and applicable body of law.  And yet, concepts of legal relevance have discernible themes and reflect a deep well of wisdom that can be harnessed for use with big data analytics.  

Illustrating the breadth of meaning consider:

1) How we establish 
a) Whether the following evidence is relevant and permitted or irrelevant therefor excluded from a rape trial in a court of law:
i) the victim dressed in a bikini the night of the rape and
* had been on the way to an annual bikini party; OR
* had a one night stand with the defendants' roommate that began with bikini wearing; OR 
*  had a history of one night stands with over 850 partners;
ii) the accused rapist was CONVICTED of rape:
* the previous year; OR
* 30 years ago;
iii) the accused rapist was ACCUSED of rape 5 years previously:
* by an escapee from the psychiatric ward of a nearby hospital who had been sentenced to involuntary commitment due to severe delusions of victimization; OR
* by 7 former employees and 4 former neighbors who dropped charges and refused to testify after accepting high dollar settlements. 
b) Whether a legislative amendment requiring government budget balancing spending cuts to welfare programs of $10 million is relevant and therefor permissible for a proposed law to build a park costing $10 million or irrelevant to the park and therefor not permitted to be voted upon; or 
c) Whether a regulation requiring licenses for fishing validly falls within the scope of enabling legislation establishing minimum fish populations or is not authorized under the law and therefor must be abolished. 
d) Whether a letter by a recently deceased man is relevant to help prove that his nephew should receive inheritance despite the fact an apparently valid signed and notarized last will and testament leaves everything to the deceased man's daughter, but: 
i) the letter, sent in duplicate to the nephew and the daughter:
* revealed the man had changed his mind and regretted leaving all his assets exclusively to his daughter, AND
* professed an earnest desire that the nephew must always have spending money and should receive at least half the assets from the will; AND
* was signed and notarized 5 years after the will was signed and just the day before the man actually died; OR
ii) the letter, signed and notarized the day before the will was signed: 
* expressed to the nephew deep sadness because the daughter had kidnapped the man's puppy and kitten and threatened to kill them unless she received everything under his will; OR
* expressed to the man's real estate attorney a confidential fear that he would not be able to hide his hallucinations and severe bipolar disorder much longer from his family and worry that he could not remember why or when he had negotiated and signed several real estate deals over the last several months; OR
iii) the letter was addressed to the daughter and was signed by the man the day after the will was signed, expressing an earnest desire that she share equally with the nephew, and included an attached document that was:
* an updated draft unsigned will leaving half his wealth to his nephew; OR
* an updated SIGNED but NOT NOTARIZED will leaving half his wealth to his nephew; OR
* an updated SIGNED and NOTARIZED will leaving half his wealth to his daughter and leaving the other half to "the love of my life" . 

To establish whether a "thing" is legally deemed relevant or irrelevant - consequently leading to dramatically different results - requires consideration of the following types of factors: 

Is the thing a "natural and probable" result of setting that is ready deemed to be relevant?  Then maybe it is relevant. 

Is the thing some proof of some other thing that shows a criminal defendant is a nice person but is not related to any element of the crime of defense? Then maybe it is not relevant. But under the same circumstances, if the prosecution asserts the defendant has a bad character or poor reputation then maybe the evidence the defendant is a nice guy is therefor relevant to the case means to "rehabilitate" the character of the litigant. 

Is the thing some proof of some other thing that is a necessary element to establish guilt? Then maybe it is relevant. But under the same circumstances if the evidence is offered too early or too late in the process then maybe it is not relevant at that point. 

If a data-set is included as part of a submission by a bank to one of it's governmental regulators to show how well loved the bank is by its account holders due to it's business lending program and opening up it's conference room for neighborhood meetings:
1. But the annual filing is submitted to "Agency A" from whose perspective  love of customers has nothing to do with the regulatory disclosure of the interest rates charged by the bank during the prior year ... then maybe the data-set and accompanying visualizations will be deemed irrelevant, not shared with more senior agency decision makers and deleted from the record of the filing;
2. However, if the annual filing is otherwise identical but submitted to "Agency B" that is responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act...  then perhaps the data-set is highly relevant and may prevent issuance of a public warning or non-compliance fee, or could enable the bank to avoid rejection of requested permission for a merger. 
3. On the other hand, if all circumstances are otherwise identical to scenario #2 BUT the bank only submits the data visualization and final analysis of the data-sets and does not include any of the raw underlying data, then maybe the information will not be considered "responsive" to the expected for disclosure and it will be deleted according to the same processes resulting in scenario #1;
4. Similarly, if all circumstances are otherwise identical to scenario #3, but: 
a) this time the filing does include underlying data showing the types of credit lines, business loans and other reinvestment measures expected by Agency B,  
b) BUT DOES NOT include the meta-data types that would needed to accomplish a legal analysis relevant to reveal and evaluate a geographic concentration of proximity demonstrating the "local" nature of investments, then maybe the bank will be assessed a fine for violation and denied approval to merge with another bank due to non-compliance. 

Potentially, a a regulated company could thrive, plateau, decline or fail based upon decisions about which data-sets are relevant to use for a given analysis or report, how they are characterized, to whom or when they are revealed. The dynamic can (and has) confounded required disclosure of data-sets purportedly meant to reveal chemical weapons, research, materials and other relevant resources ... potentially leading to diplomatic or military consequences. 

Beyond the legal, regulatory or political repercussions of choices or opposing views on what data-sets are or are not relevant in a given scenario there is the much more interesting question of how the fine grained targeting capabilities of legal relevance can be applied to selecting things like the relevant data-sets, the relevant points of cross-tabulation across data-sets, the relevant dimensions of data, the relevant nodes of data, the relevant edges of data and the relevant relationships between data and the intended focus of inquiry for which the data is invoked. 

To begin an exploration of how the tools and rules related to legal concepts of relevance could be applied to big data analytics and and computational sciences, a look at the key underlying precepts establishing, enshrining and enforcing the rules of relevance is needed. And to gain access to understanding these precepts, it is helpful to examine how the question of relevance arises in commonly encountered situations drawn from a wide range of legal circumstances and bodies of law.  

To ground a broad range of examples and spotlight the axiomatic mechanism of legal relevance, the concept of evidentiary relevance in adversarial litigation must be described. The rules of evidence in civil and criminal courts - both military and civilian provides a working model of the most basic conceptual cornerstones of legal relevance. The ability to determine what is and is not relevant by learning to reliably apply rules of evidence in a litigation context can be leveraged, extrapolated and applied to guide choices about what data-sets, hypotheses, statistical methods and visualizations are most relevant (or relevant at all) under any given set of circumstances.  

The idea is to have an explicit basis to merge or add the essence of legal approaches to relevance into your original description. 

2. Using exclusively or predominantly one or more of the above legal approaches to defining and applying relevance, describe:

a) How could an entrepreneurial team or individual assess which data-sets are relevant to collect in order to establish expected profits and losses for a potential app.  The app would provide quantified self and life coaching methods to achieve better physical and financial health with a personalized dashboard for users based on collected personal data - by consent of the user - including their medical records and workout data as well as the their banking, credit card and debt payment records. 

b) How could lawyer(s) assess which data-sets are relevant to collect in order to establish total economic value of losses caused to consumers by the above app if:

i) the losses were caused because the software developer accidentally coded the app to apply the financial projection formula to the consumer's health data and the health and wellness scoring formula was applied to the financial data of the consumer; or

ii) What if the losses were caused by a false advertising campaign asserting the app would ensure higher income, less debt, greater strength and lower chloresteral. What if there were additional losses based on unfair and deceptive trade practices resulting from deliberate violation of privacy policy promises not to sell the personal data to direct marketing and insurance companies?  

b) How could lawyer(s) assess which data-sets are relevant to collect in order to establish total economic value owed to a company founder for buyout of her 33.3% ownership of the above software app venture, based on current value and 3 years of future predicted gains. 

3. Contexts of Contexts 

Move the point of view, so that the question of a) prospective future profits b) total losses and c) relative value share were from the vantage point of an i) investor or ii) regulator or iii) politician running for re-election or iv) marxist advocate of economic reform? 

Change the lens such that the salient view is appropriate for i)?an enterprise architecture or ii) sociological topology or iii) news and journalism treatment or iv) historical overview of the events depicted. 

Change the scope of focus by zooming in and out. What parties and transactions and institutions and visualizations are comprehensible with tightly zoomed in scope showing minute granularity vs long range zoomed out scope showing a global overview? 

Try a different frame of reference all together (eg rather than a framework of total economic value what if the framework is aggregate time allocated to activities or geographic clusters and dispersion of activities or behavioral analysis based on religion and age, etc)? 

At what point is it clear which data-sets are and are not relevant to collect in order to establish economic impact of a) losses caused by badly coded and failed software or b) value generated by well coded and successful software? Are 

3. In view of how you demonstrated a legally based analysis of relevance would be applied above, how (if at all) would you therefore refine your statement "In the context of entrepreneurship, understanding what is relevant means to understand the problem we seek to address from as many angles as practicable."  If you would not alter the statement, please share a few words as to why you view the original assertion of what relevance "means" for entrepreneurship reflects or (appropriately) excludes the legal approach to relevance.

What is relevant? Relevance arises from the determination that objects can fall inside or outside a given context. Originating from the Latin relevantem/relevare (lit. helpful/re+raise), "relevance" refers to that which supports, relates to, or builds up a context. It is the rule that allows for the classification of objects and the demarkation of a conceptual boundary. To confine "relevance" to the status of a simple rule would be to understate its power; relevance is a meta-rule, a rule about rules.

Relevance guides all rules defining what belongs inside a given system. 


In the context of entrepreneurship, understanding what is relevant means to understand the problem we seek to address from as many angles as practicable. All working parts of a business idea should pass the test of relevance: the problem addressed must be relevant, as must its solution. The users of a product or service ultimately determine its relevance, and entrepreneurial relevance must therefore be defined with users in mind. In this sense, relevance provides a litmus test that allows us to focus on a utility-seeking allocation of resources.

One danger of applying "relevance" as a filter is that it, like all static definitions, curtails possibility. Relevance is useful in assessing whether services or products support a solution, but its exclusive nature can also lead us to discard the ideas that fall "outside the box". To preserve innovative competitiveness, entrepreneurs should ensure that their understanding of "relevance" stays dynamic: a solution that was relevant in the past is not necessarily relevant now, and what is relevant in one location is not necessarily relevant in another. The only characteristic that stays constant across contexts is the need for dynamic relevance itself.
