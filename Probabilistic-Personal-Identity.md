Probabilistic Personal Identity 

* What is the current practice of predictive analytics vis-a-vis identity of individuals? 

* How does this relate to PII definition of identity.  Can we construct a PDS that seeds parameters? 

* How could the New Deal on Data Resolve issues and create more value for this trend?

 “What is Probabilistic Identity” in the Context of Privacy, Big Data and FIPS?  

a) What is a model of identity for descriptive and predictive analytics: 
* vectors
* parameters
* 360 descriptions (maps, topologies, connections, edges, nodes, etc) 
* predictions 

b) How does current privacy and FIPS work - and fall short - for  Probabilistic Identity

c) What is a better way to structure legal and policy overlays for  Probabilistic Identity
