##Background

Plain Language is a research initiative, headed by Legal Physics, aiming to test out measurable methods with which we can clarify the law and make it easier for citizens to understand.

Public offices are beginning to provide the law as open data accessible on online interfaces. As the law becomes freely accessible, we are concerned with how the law can also be clear and understandable to the public. Local and federal government offices have an obligation to make the law accessible to its citizens. Making legal knowledge freely accessible online provides citizens with the opportunity to understand the legal consequences of their actions in advance. However, for citizens to understand whether or not they are complying with legal statutes, they must fully comprehend the law. This initiative raises enormous questions about future compliance with the law. For example, if the law is both widely accessed and as clear as possible, would certain crimes occur less frequently?

##Objectives

**Interface
A website where the law will be organized and easily accessible is the ultimate goal of this project. One initial possibility for presenting the law in plain language would be to annotate every statute on the site in plain language.
