## Notes

**One Goal of the Project**

In [Peter Tiersma's book "Legal Language,"](http://www.languageandlaw.org/LEGALLANG/LEGALLANG.HTM) he writes that economic incentives and strategic motivations play a significant role in lawyers' language choice. For example, when a client is paying a large fee, there is motivation to be verbose. Or, "when a document is written for a busy court, however, lawyers realize they have to get to the point quickly." Tiersma is suggesting that lawyers actively use language as a toolkit to their own end or perhaps their client's end. In other words, lawyers are in control of their word choice. It will be our job to strip legal language of particular motives and articulate plain, untampered, and clear information.

**Specific Linguistic Tendencies in Legal Language According to Tiersma**

Unusual sentence structure: Lawyers make use of unusual sentence structures, as in a proposal to effect with the Society an assurance, which is taken from an insurance policy.  Often these unusual structures result in separating the subject from the verb, or splitting the verb complex, which can reduce comprehension.
