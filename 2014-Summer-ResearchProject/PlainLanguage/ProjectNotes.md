**Goals of the Project**

Improve Existing Attempts to Make Legal Language Clear: Many attempts to move legal language from obscurity to clarity do so in the form of online dictionaries. On such example is [Rocket Lawyer's Plain Legal Language Dictionary](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/legal-dictionary.rl). These attempts, however, leave the hard work of translating legal complexities into clear plain language to the user. In other words, there has not been a successful attempt to provide users with pre-translated legal documents in plain language on a massive scale. There have, however, been recent Federal attempts to provide citizens with clear legal documents. In 2010, Obama passed the Plain Writing Act, which requires all federal agencies to use language that is plain and easy to understand. The Federal Web Managers Council has encouraged various federal agencies to provide legal documents in a clear and accessible medium. The issue, however, is that none of the documents are consolidated into one website where users can access and search for plain language translations of legal statutes. 

Strip Legal Language of its Political Motivations: In [Peter Tiersma's book "Legal Language,"](http://www.languageandlaw.org/LEGALLANG/LEGALLANG.HTM) he writes that economic incentives and strategic motivations play a significant role in lawyers' language choice. For example, when a client is paying a large fee, there is motivation to be verbose. Or, "when a document is written for a busy court, however, lawyers realize they have to get to the point quickly." Tiersma is suggesting that lawyers actively use language as a toolkit to their own end or perhaps their client's end. In other words, lawyers are in control of their word choice. It will be our job to strip legal language of particular motives and articulate plain, untampered, and clear information.

**Linguistic Tendencies in Legal Language**

Unusual sentence structure: Lawyers make use of unusual sentence structures, as in a proposal to effect with the Society an assurance, which is taken from an insurance policy.  Often these unusual structures result in separating the subject from the verb, or splitting the verb complex, which can reduce comprehension.

**Suggestions for Achieving Linguistic Clarity**

Constrained Language/Avoiding Pronouns: Rather than using a pronoun after a person or thing is introduced, repeat the pronoun. Pronouns can sometimes have ambiguous reference, so this technique can indeed enhance precision. [Peter Tiersma's "Legal Language,"](http://www.languageandlaw.org/LEGALLANG/LEGALLANG.HTM)
