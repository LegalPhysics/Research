The following excerpt was authored by Dazza Greenwood as part of  creating a conceptual design for the re-launch of a Kansas Business Center online service.


# Begin with the End in Mind: Establishing the Mission and Success Metrics

The INK Board and potentially any stakeholder steering group it may develop to help steward re-design of the Kansas Business Center must establish the authoritative vision, mission, goals and objectives that will guide architecture and operations going forward.

At a very high level of abstraction, the mission of the Kansas Business Center is impliedly to reduce the obstacles or needless time required for a new business to form in Kansas. But below that generic policy aim, there are an array of implicit and potentially different assumptions about the intended mission, goals and objectives for the effort. While the recommended general direction and conceptual design approach described in this report is of general merit, it cannot substitute for governance processes, executive judgment, and decision-making about the destination, path and speed of progress expected. The business practices and models, legal and policy rules as well as the technical or operational processes should explicitly reflect and support success and achievement as defined by the decision makers.

Whether the vision, goals and technical solutions approach proposed by this Report are ratified in their entirely, in part or totally replaced with a fresh approach, the most important outcome is that the intended purposes and outcomes for Kansas Business Center be discussed, deliberated and clearly decided. Based upon an agreed high level vision and path, the ultimate selection of methods and mechanisms to achieve the outcomes can be conclusively evaluated and decided. However, the process of exploring and reporting upon high value innovating opportunities now available for use by Kansas Business Center has resulted in a rich set of options for consideration by the decision makers.

As an outgrowth of the analysis performed as part of the environmental scan that is summarized in this report, the team developed a set of proposed goals for the Kansas Business Center. Next, they developed a set of principles that represent best practices and general criteria that can be used to evaluate options for improvement of the Kansas Business Center in line with those goals. The following summary of these Goals and Decision-Making Principles are offered to provide a starting point for the governance and executive management process recommended by this Report.

# Proposed Kansas Business Center Mission and Goals

The principal goals of the Kansas Business Center should be:

To enable entrepreneurs to easily identify and quickly complete the filings necessary to form a business in Kansas.

Once formed, to allow businesses to refer to a single source to maintain and access their filings with the State.

To increase the accuracy, while reducing data entry, complexity and processing time for the submission of business filings to the State.

To improve the openness, sharing, and reuse of data about business activity in support of policy making and to further economic development.

To integrate payment processing and account management for these transactions

# Proposed Decision-making Principles

In evaluating the alternative proposed in the following section, the solution approach selected should: Implement functionality that supports business registration, filing, payments, and ongoing reporting in a way that is as seamless as possible to the end user, so that it:

Minimizes or eliminates the need for the user to re-enter data across systems and agencies “Remembers” the user across organizational boundaries and time Allows users access to their own data, as well as exercise fine-grained controls on sharing with both the state and, over time, other parties they choose. Amplifies the value of the business identity established as more transactions are conducted Incorporates lessons learned and capabilities for ongoing assistance to businesses by Network Kansas. Integrate with a common payment system for business registration filing and reporting activities with the State.

Use a technical solution that accommodates the integration of backend agency processes and systems in a way that:

Minimizes up-front investment and ongoing cost Is standards-based Is secure Is stable, scalable, and minimizes technical risks in implementation and support Uses a framework of configurable “components” that are reusable and extensible to new processes and agencies Allows changes in processes or requirements to be easily implemented and maintained. Makes use of open source technology, where appropriate, carefully weighing the cost/benefit of “open code” with the advantages of commercial off-the-shelf software packages and third party hosting that can reduce the complexity and resources required for maintenance. New agencies or processes can be added and integrated over time without significant rework, risks. Focuses on reducing redundancy and complexity in the current electronic process.

Design the user experience in such a way that:

Mirrors best practices across public and commercial applications Portrays transitions across organizational boundaries in government as seamless, both horizontally and vertically Leverages private and public sector best practices and incorporates the functionality desired by intermediaries who file and maintain records on behalf of business owners in both batch and individual mode.

# Establishing Use Cases, Requirements, and Constraints

Establishing detailed requirements, constraints and use cases intended to drive the software code development, integration or configuration of specific technologies is beyond the scope of this Report. However, such detailed decision are necessary at the appropriate moment in the process of re-design for the Kansas Business Center and should be preceded by and aligned with the INK Board’s eventual determination of vision, purpose and goals for the Kansas Business Center. The detailed use cases must also reflect and support a process of negotiated consensus building among all the key stakeholders that will depend upon, operate or otherwise significantly impact or be impacted by the system. Chief among these stakeholders are the Kansas businesses that the system is primarily intended to benefit and second the agencies, departments and other organs of government that will interoperate with and through the system. The detailed functionality for Kansas Business Center improvements and specific requirements from other state agencies or local units of Kansas government is not, therefore, intended to be part of this conceptual design. See the Next Steps and Recommendations section of this report for recommendations on further work to be done in this area.

# Relationship between Success Metrics, Goals and Data-Driven Systems

One important implication of adopting the Web 2.0 approach described in the proposed conceptual design described in this report is that it enables easy real-time reporting and automation potential for virtually all business interactions, legal processes and technical operations occurring on or with the Kansas Business Center.

This is because the architecture calls for careful deployment of "flow event identifiers" at key points across the system. Since the approach calls for an entirely data-driven and web 2.0 implementation, the interposition of standard system logging is not only possible but easily deployed in a uniform manner at all layers and dimensions of the system. Whether a new business has been successfully formed, a server patch installed, a help desk inquiry answered or a user authorization to share data granted, the same type of flow event identifiers can be sensed, secured and stored. Once stored in a standard format within a designated file or data-set, appropriate apps and services can easily be configured to notice, alert, refresh, push, pull, get, put or otherwise triggered to take expected actions.

The activity with external apps and services that are registered as clients with the KBC or to which the KBC is registered as a client would have Flow Event IDs sensing, creating, preserving and communicating activity with the KBC. For example, each time a given app requested access to a protected Profile Attribute, an event would be logged not only to effectuate the first-order permission flow by the user, but also to feed real time management oversight, performance monitoring and later oversight and audit analysis. In addition, the same Flow Event ID can and should be used to feed internal and partner business intelligence, market analysis and trend spotting analytics or in some cases could even trigger payment processes for cost share, revenue share or other consequent or second-order data-driven transactions.

# What to Measure

In order to make the best available evaluation of whether desired or expected outcomes intended to result from the KBC have occurred, a set of relevant measures and criteria will be needed.

KBC Management Metrics: Traceable Outcomes, Goals and Objectives

Operations and processes of Kansas Business Center can be defined, designed and deployed such that the right data is created for measuring success. System performance metrics tied to goals and objective can be linked to measurable outcomes for stakeholders. The outcomes for businesses and the economy can in turn provide a traceable link to realization of the big picture purposes and vision intended for the KBC. Management of the operations of Kansas Business Center can be anchored upon and evaluated against a regularized system-wide set of such performance metrics.

Example Goal: Promote New Business Formation

Let's say that the driving goal for the KBC ultimately agreed by all parties concerned were the promotion of increasing the number of new businesses created in Kansas. The measures of achievement for this goal could be accomplished directly in a fairly superficial way by simply coding an annual report of the total number of business entities created and observing whether the number was increasing or not. However, the lower level objectives that comprise a high level goal will have their own particular measures based on what types of data are available and relevant. It would be necessary to break the general goal of new business formation into smaller clusters of objectives and tasks in part to develop better tuned and more actionable business intelligence.

# Narrative Policy Objectives

Ideally, to ensure measurable performance and progress toward intended outcomes, each objective should be clearly construed by KBC system providers not only to align project planning, budget allocation and communications strategy but also to specify, scope, standardize and share the actual data needed for analytics and predictive modeling that can determine success at meeting the objective.

Typically, however, goals and objectives are stated in narrative prose that effectively relays a general state of affairs but frequently does not objectively translate to clear metrics and objective expressions of criteria indicating whether or when the objectie has been achieved. The ambiguity can be useful to some extent, in order to permit or even invite creative interpretations and approached rather than prejudge how the challenge will best be addressed. However this method of describing goals, objectives and tasks can itself be refined in order to better reach the profound potential available from big data driven networked systems such as that proposed for the next version of the KBC.

In a reduced form example, imagine a vision statement that included the phrase: "Promote, Protect, Prepare and Propel New Business in Kansas".

The item "prepare", then, could be measured by how quickly and completely profile information of a given KBC business account is updated with relevant and important dashboard visualizations, alerts or, if desired, by enabling new businesses to “opt-in” to allow prospective business partners to discover relevant background information about them to prepare for a sales call, plan to better compete in the open market or perform due diligence in anticipation of a possible partnership. Similarly, the item calling for state government to help "propel" Kansas business could be measured by how many KBC businesses experienced an increase in revenue, or expanded work force.

# Measurable Data-Driven Objectives

Consider the potential for data-driven design when a key objective is articulated like this: "Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation". The measure of this example objective is ultimately about the reduction of "frictions" or "impediments" slowing down formation of new business and it is stated in a form that anticipates the kinds of data-sets, types of data services and particular data sources needed to compute achievement of the objective.

The criteria used for this example objective would relate to comparative analysis between a new KBC system and a prior KBC system or perhaps a comparison with a system of one or more other states in order to benchmark the extent to which the KBC system reduced factors identified as holding back new business formation.

The data acquired should be sufficiently relevant and regularized and refined to establish one way or the other if the KBC produced each of the identified intended results. Reduction of complexity negatively impacting users could potentially be measured by direct data such as calculating the respective number options displayed on the user interface by each system respectively, or the respective number of steps in a process needed to complete an action or the respective number of sessions abandoned prior to completion of an active task. Reduction of time needed to form a new business could be measured by the respective total active session times needed to complete the initial business formation alone and augmented to show views of the total elapsed time in days/hours/minutes from the initiation of the new business formation task until the task completion, including inactive session time during which the user had saved a partially completed form or paused an open process to be continued at later times. Similarly, the amount of time reduction could be measured based upon the time a user completes all required state government interactions in order to open the business to the public, potentially including tax, licensing, permits and other approvals, notices or disclosures. To the extent the related agency processes could be consolidated, accelerated or otherwise facilitated by the KBC system, reductions in time needed to form a new business could be demonstrated. Reduction of costs could also be measured in a number of direct and indirect ways based on data available from or to the KBC.

One can easily see how once some consensus around clear goals and objectives supporting the vision and purposes for the KBC are established, it is possible to greatly increase the adaptive power of a Web 2.0 data driven systems design by describing the requisite goals, objectives and outcomes in data and service friendly ways. In this way, it is possible to view the vision and outcomes on a kind of map and to use relevant data-sets, apps and services as sensors, propulsion and navigation of the KBC system toward its intended destination. While most of the factors and information sources related to goals and objectives for public sector systems are not available easily or at all in an appropriate data-driven mode or accessibly by service oriented networked methods, nonetheless the business community is generally far ahead of state governments. In particular, if KBC were to re-establish itself as a data-intensive and web 2.0 service friendly system then the expression of goals and objectives as computable values will be both possible and highly advisable for those contexts where the intended outcomes are easily and naturally available already.

Not long after a KBC system is established as data-driven components in a dynamic networked environment, the people and processes comprising governance and management of the KBC will becomes more familiar with, competent at and fluent about the operation, maintenance and iterative evolution of these types of systems. In fact, the operation of a REST based service for OAuth2 capable apps and services is not rocket science. This is a design pattern successfully fueling a vast number of apps and services owned, operated and updated daily by teenagers, people starting web 2.0 businesses during nights and weekends and innumerable garage and living room ventures. The overlay of production grade and government adapted processes and procedures can and should be less complicated than the manner of overlay of the same methods with past operational environments.

Once there is a minimum competency with the flows and functions of the type of data-driven architecture being proposed for KBC, it will be increasingly possible not only to formulate ever more goals and objectives as computationally expressible algorithms and analytics but also to start to describe higher level Purposes and Vision as well. The example of a goal presented earlier - "Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation" - demonstrated how data-driven processes can be designed as automated success metrics. Consider the following high level outline demonstrating how the same basic approach can be used as part of a more comprehensive set of goals that are each themselves tied to higher level vision and outcomes as well as mutually supportive of other related goals:

Vision: Support and Enhance the Business Environment of Kansas With Kansas Business Center Outcome: Utilize Funding and Authority of INK Statute to Innovate Kansas Business Center Outcome: Utilize Redesigned KBC to Promote a Vibrant Innovation Economy for Kansas

Goal 1: Promote New Business Formation 
Objective 1.A Reduce Complexity, Time and Cost of New Business Formation 
Objective 1.B Increase Access to Resources for New Business Formation 
Objective 1.C Reward Data, Apps and Services Using KBC to Promote New Business Formation

Goal 2. Enhance Value of Ongoing Business Interactions With State Government 
Objective 2.A Align INK and KBC Incentives and Success Metrics With Vision and Goals 
Objective 2.B Reduce Duplicative, Manual and Optional Administrative Interaction 
Objective 2.C Amplify Business Capabilities and Intelligence With Real-Time Open Data

Goal 3. Catalyze Expansion, Innovation & Capital Formation for Kansas Businesses 
Objective 3.A Enable Strategic Use of Information Technology By and For Business 
Objective 3.B Amplify Value of State Business Data to Promote Innovation and Expansion 
Objective 3.C Leverage Public/Private Partnership to Catalyze Capital Investment

The same approach used with business goals and objectives with data-driven metrics postulated above can also be applied to the legal and technical aspects of the Kansas Business Center. To ensure the legal and technical aspects properly support and reflect the business requirements and constraints that decision makers will expect of a redesigned KBC, corresponding goals, objectives and supporting relevant data-sets and criteria are needed to define success metrics for the electronic and automated legal agreements and system rules as well as for the technical standards, available system functionality and developer resources needed to achieve the overall vision and outcomes desired. By aligning, harmonizing and integrating the business, legal and technical goals, objectives and literal rules and online processes the future redesigned Kansas Business Center can be a fully data-driven, completely networked and widely distributed, massively scalable and profoundly interoperable model of next generation online government.

# Limitations

While the vision of a fully digital business center is compelling, the evolution to a comprehensively web 2.0 public enterprise must be a process rather than an event. Cultural change, testing, piloting, migration, stabilization, maintenance, sustainability, iteration and resilience to surprising events requires a period of time measured in years, not months. Change management to accomplish responsible staging and phasing of deep innovation while ensuring business and user operational continuity of service is challenging. Furthermore, the rest of the state of Kansas and the world will take time to change as well, but the Kansas Business Center must support users and partners with a wide range of technical prowess against a background of evolving technologies.

In the context of data-driven success metrics, not all outcomes are capable of assessment solely from the data generated by or available through the KBC or any single system. Relevant data and other measurable information both from the KBC system itself and also from other relevant sources will be needed in some instances in order to evaluate whether a goal or objective has been achieved. Certain external systems would provide ready sources of relevant data in the same manner as the KBC system precisely through the REST based interfaces employed to interoperate with the KBC via Web 2.0 approach proposed. For instance, activity with integrated apps and services can and should have Flow Event IDs associated with all key interactions - especially those involving user permissions or core business transactions. Most data within or at in/out touch points between the KBC and external systems would not require Flow Event IDs because regular logging and deep detailed reporting would be sufficient to maintain a record if future review is needed but no real time actions or visibility are important.

In most cases, the majority of activity in external systems will be inaccessible to parties governing or managing the KBC and business relationships or contracts will be needed to ensure some level of reporting or notification of key information over time. Examples could include anything from survey data on how system account holders incorporate their KBC data into other parts of business to backend transactional or performance data by third party app and service providers allowed to offer an interface to the KBC transactions. The current state of reporting by external parties is typically not provided as an online automated service in a data-driven manner allowing real-time business, legal and technical processes or automation. While there are significant advantaged to seeking a fully web 2.0 footing for the KBC it is important to note that much key data and business intelligence will source from external systems of varying quality, in varying types and by varying methods. Even more importantly, the individual users of the Kansas Business Center have a wide range of technical and legal starting points and will it require time, information, and educations to become familiar with this approach.
