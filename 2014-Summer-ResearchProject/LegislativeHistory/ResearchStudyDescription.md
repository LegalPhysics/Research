## The Role of Committees in the Legislative Process

Once a representative sponsors a bill, it goes to a specific committee, which will either approve or reject its movement to the lower chamber to be debated. Dazza mentioned many experienced legislators can often predict whether or not a bill will pass based on the committee to which it is sent. The committee process can obscure the efficiency and transparency of getting a bill to be debated in the lower chamber.

The computational legal science team is currently collaborating with the Uniform Laws Commission to apply data analytics to measure NCCUSL success in passing specific bills once those bills make it to the lower chamber. It will be relevant, however, to analyze what factors allow bills to even make it all the way up to the lower chamber for debate. This research may reveal ways we can analyze committee trends in approving or rejecting legislature.
