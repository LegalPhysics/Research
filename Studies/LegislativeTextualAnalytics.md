Thanks for the article.  That's a great use case - using software (possibly plagiarism checking software?) to find language chunks from a source set and seeing if/when/how often they occur in a target set of language, in this case bills.  

It occurs to me this approach would allow one to study the influence of interest-group-backed multi-state legislation by getting metrics on how quickly and widely their bills are introduced and how they progress.  This study shows that you could use text analysis to find interest group language in bills introduced by or sponsored by legislators.  That would be very cool. 

Does anyone know if there are any text analytics tools in use in the Media Lab?  Just as an experiment, I have used the web-based Textalyser.com.  I fed in several State of the Union Speeches to see some metrics on them.  It would be interesting to know if there is a tool around that we should be thinking about standardizing on, either because the Lab uses it or because people have heard good things.

Thanks for sharing the link to the Post article.
