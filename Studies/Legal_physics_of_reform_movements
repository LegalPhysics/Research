There are dozens if not hundreds of legal protections at the state level (child labor, minimum wage, right to organize, initiave petition, recall, etc.).  For all of these, there was a time when no state had such laws.  Some event initiated the reforms, after which the reform "movement" propogated through space (state to state) and time, resulting in all states having such laws.
